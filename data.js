    {user: '63421110d511c14663cee54c', name: 'Munds Wagon Trail', location: 'Sedona, Arizona', caption: "One of my favorite AND lesser known trails in Sedona. Munds Wagon Trail is an easy hike that can be either as long or as short as you'd like it to be with minimal elevation gain. My favorite part of this scenic trail is how little people I run into on this trail. The silence you can find there is palpable in the most serene way.", isOpen: true , pictures: 'https://i.imgur.com/Urws3ig.jpg'},
    {user: '63421110d511c14663cee54c', name: 'Sugarloaf Mountain', location: 'Marquette, Michigan', caption: "A truly unexpected gem! When you think of the Midwest, you tend to think of mountainous terrain as the antithesis to it. Upon hiking this trail, you are unexpectedly met with a beautiful and moderately challenging climb cloaked with dense and vibrant foliage. The view of Lake Superior atop is about as good as you can get.", isOpen: true, pictures: 'https://i.imgur.com/6tQLBdj.jpg'},
    {user: '63421110d511c14663cee54c', name: 'Crater Lake', location: 'Oregon', caption: "This goes down as one of the most stunning parks I have ever been to. The views in every single direction are worth a trip to see. One side, you have the bluest lake you've ever seen; the other side, you see the surrounding Oregon wilderness as being at crater lake puts you among the state's other prominent peaks.", isOpen: true, pictures: 'https://i.imgur.com/POecS7Z.jpg'},

I mean look at this thing, it's like 1000 footballs tall.", isOpen: true, pictures: 'https://i.imgur.com/sJW0BRa.jpg'},
    {user: '63421110d511c14663cee54c', name: 'Canyon Lake', location: 'Arizona', caption: "Here's the game-plan: you, whoever is reading this, have to go get an inflatable paddleboard asap, or rent a stand-up paddleboard at a shop nearby to the lake, and you have to go deep into the river that flows into the lake. That river intersects these enormous canyon walls with beautiful natural carvings rife with wildlife (like bald eagle nests!!). You gotta go. I don't make the rules.", isOpen: true, pictures: 'https://i.imgur.com/nnhgqVg.jpg'},
