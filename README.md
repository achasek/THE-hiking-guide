# THE Hiking Guide

A simple and social medium for hiking!

## About

I have combined two of my favorite hobbies into a collective passion project. I have built a simple, full-stack web application that utilizes full CRUD functionality: Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting data. The data in question? Data you can actually use to take a hike. If you're anything like me the past week having forgotten what outside is even like, you probably need it! 

## Technologies Used

- HTML5/EJS
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES2022/Node.JS
- Express
- MongoDB/ MongoDB Atlas
- Mongoose
- Google OAuth
- Google Cloud

The best part of the deal: all you gotta do is click this link: https://the-hiking-guide.onrender.com
Although, this app is best enjoyed in Google Chrome
