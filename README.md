# THE Hiking Guide

A simple and social medium for hiking!

## Description

I have combined two of my favorite hobbies into a collective passion project. I have built a simple, full-stack web application that utilizes full CRUD functionality: Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting data. The data in question? Data you can actually use to take a hike. If you're anything like me the past week having forgotten what outside is even like, you probably need it! 

## Technologies Used

CSS
Node.JS
Express
MongoDB/ MongoDB Atlas
